## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Working with an API - This was the first time working with an API. The first day I read documentation and scetched the app on paper. 

- Javascript programming - Im relative new to javascript so I had to take my time with functions like: forEach() or fetch() and events.

- Realise how little I actually know about hard coding -  I do often have a way to implement someting in theory, lucky I dont have to reinvent the wheel. #stackoverflow

- Time management - I spent roughly 48hours on this project, including reading documentation. Lucky for me I dont need more than a few hours of sleep, my wife and kids might beg to differ.
